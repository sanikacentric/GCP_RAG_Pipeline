1. Ingestion Layer: Scalable Document Streaming

The pipeline begins with ingesting documents from multiple sources in real time or batches.

Cloud Storage: Serves as the central upload trigger for 10M+ documents.

Cloud Pub/Sub: Instantly notifies downstream services of new document uploads.

Cloud Dataflow: A serverless Apache Beam pipeline that normalizes document formats, extracts metadata, and scales horizontally.

Key Benefits:

Unified batch + streaming architecture

Serverless, auto-scaling

Handles malformed or encrypted files gracefully

2. Text Extraction and Preprocessing

Accurate parsing of unstructured and semi-structured content is critical.

Document AI: Extracts structured data like tables, key-value pairs, and layout from scanned PDFs and forms.

Cloud Functions / Dataflow: Cleans, classifies, and chunks text.

BigQuery: Acts as an audit-compliant repository for cleaned, structured text and metadata.

Special Models Used:

OCR with Layout

Invoice and Procurement Parsers

3. Embedding Generation and Indexing

Text chunks are transformed into high-dimensional vector embeddings to enable semantic search.

Vertex AI Embeddings (Gecko@001): Generates 768-dimensional dense vectors for each text segment.

Vertex AI Vector Search + Matching Engine:

Indexes document vectors with filterable metadata.

Supports hybrid search and nearest-neighbor retrieval.

4. RAG Workflow: Retrieval & Generation

This is the core intelligence layer where natural language questions are answered.

Retrieval Phase:

Query embeddings are matched with the closest document vectors in Vertex AI Vector Search.

Generation Phase:

Top-k relevant chunks are passed to Gemini Pro via Vertex AI Prediction.

Responses are generated with source-grounded summarization and strict hallucination guardrails.

Prompt Engineering:

Legal summarization instructions

Snippet highlighting

‚ÄúAnswer only from context‚Äù constraint

5. Observability & Analytics

To ensure trust and transparency, monitoring and feedback mechanisms were embedded.

Cloud Logging + Monitoring: Tracks latency, usage, errors, and response times.

Looker Studio + BigQuery: Interactive dashboards for compliance teams to view:

Most queried policies

Retrieval vs generation accuracy

User feedback trends

6. Security, Compliance, and Cost Optimization

Built-in enterprise-grade governance ensures data safety and cost-efficiency.

Cloud KMS: Customer-managed encryption keys

IAM + Workload Identity Federation: Role-based access control

VPC Service Controls: Prevents data exfiltration

Coldline Storage + Auto-scaling Dataflow: Reduces archival and processing costs
